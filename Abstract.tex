\noindent The first cryptographic hashing algorithms date back to to the late 70's, although not until the 90's did the popularity of hashing functions increase enough to produce the first widely used algorithms, MD5 and SHA-1. Cryptanalysts later found serious security weaknesses in these hashing functions which forced cryptographers to look deeper into the research of hashing algorithms. NIST later would announce a competition to produce a new hashing algorithm, which would become known as SHA-3.

This thesis looks further into SHA-3 and looks to produce an application which could be embedded into web-pages to further help understand and demonstrate how SHA-3 works. The application will be designed to give the user a deep understanding into SHA-3 rather than just a vague idea of what the algorithm does. Not only will this tool be useful for the understanding of SHA-3 but it will also give cryptanalysts a tool to further analyse SHA-3.

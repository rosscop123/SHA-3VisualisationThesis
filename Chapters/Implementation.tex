\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter will discuss the process in which the application was created and will look at each individual step within this process. There are 4 main areas to be discussed. Firstly, generating a basic 3D world, then building on this to produce a representation of the state which allows user interaction. The next task, which is independent to the first, would be to produce the SHA-3 algorithm. It will then look at producing the specific tools for the application, as previously mentioned in chapter 3. Finally, it will look at implementing the user interface, with the navigation keys and menu.
\vspace{5mm}\\
The reason for breaking a large project down into stages, is to allow each stage to be tested individually and to allow for any bugs to be caught early on in the development. Therefore isolating the bug to a specific area and making the solution of any problems much simpler. Although when developing like this it does introduce new problems such as compatibility. Therefore, ensuring that when developing two individual systems, which are to be merged later, it is important that the same format for shared data is used, making merging the systems much easier.
\vspace{5mm}\\
\textit{All of the objects and Java3D terminology in this chapter will be discussed in the level of detailed required to gain a good understanding, but for more information visit the Java3D documentation page\cite{Java3dDoc}.}
\vspace{10mm}\\
\section{3D World}
Developing a 3D world, containing a visual representation of a state, is the foundation of this application, meaning this is the best place to start developing the application. The first task is to develop a ``universe'', using the Java3D library . A ``universe'' contains the canvas, which is where all the 3D objects are drawn. 
\vspace{5mm}\\
The CreateCubes class is where the 3D world is produced. It uses predefined static variables to set the width, depth and height of each cube in the state, where as the users initial view of the state varies, and is calculated, dependant upon the size of the state in use. This is to ensure a better user experience when dealing with larger states.
\vspace{5mm}\\
Directional lighting is produced within this class, to give the user a sense of depth when visualising the state. The lighting is implemented such that the light souce appears to be just off screen. The positioning of the lighting is set with a 3D vector, vector3f, and the correct positioning is essential to making the viewing of the state ease on the eye.
\vspace{5mm}\\
The class also holds two 3-dimensional arrays. The first, ``cubes'', is used to control the cubes which are used to visualise state. Each element stores a single cube, with the appearance of that cubes also kept alongside it, making it vary easy to change the colour, shading and lighting of each cube. The second array, ``currentState'', stores the current values of the state. The values stored in this array is dependant on what the visualisation is required to show. For example, if the state was required to display SHA-3 then the values stored will be either a 1 or 0.
\vspace{5mm}\\
 Each 3D array is indexed such that access the same point in each array refers to the same point in the state. This makes updating the cube much easier, as when the values of the state need to be changed, it is simple to also update the cubes appearance at the same time.
\vspace{5mm}\\
Figure \ref{fig:appState} shows the current representation of the state, if populated with random bits, where black cubes represent a bit value of 1 and white cubes represent a bit value of 0.

    \label{fig:appState}
\end{figure}
\section{SHA-3 Algorithm}
The SHA-3 algorithm is developed in its own class, ``SHA3'', and the class consists of 7 functions
\vspace{5mm}\\
The first 5 functions are the sub-rounds, Theta, Rho, Pi, Chi and Iota. Each take in the 3-dimensional array, the state, with the exception of Iota, which also takes in an integer, the current round. The output of each function is the state, returned in the same format as it was input, a 3-dimensional array.
\vspace{5mm}\\
After completing each of the sub-rounds, it becomes very simple to produce the 6th function, a complete single round of SHA-3, by simple running each sub-round sequentially in succession. Then repeating each round the required number of times, 24 for the complete SHA-3 algorithm, produces a complete algorithm. The complete SHA-3 function can be seen in figure \ref{fig:completeSHA-3}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
SHA3(int[][][] state) {
  for (int i = 0; i < rounds ; i++) {
    state = theta(state);
    state = rho(state);
    state = pi(state);
    state = chi(state);
    state = iota(state, i);
  }
  printHash(state);
};
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Complete dunction for SHA-3}
\label{fig:completeSHA-3}
\end{figure}
\vspace{5mm}\\
The final function takes in a state as input and outputs a string. This function represents the final stage of SHA-3, returning a hexadecimal string, the hashed value, of the input.
\subsubsection{Problems}
When producing the algorithm in the Java programming language, taking an implementation of the algorithm already produced in not a possibility. As previously mentioned, other implementations merge the sub-rounds together into one concise function.
\vspace{5mm}\\
Alongside the aforementioned issue, other implementation can sometimes be difficult to understand what is occuring in each of the sub-round functions. Functions which allow for an easier understand could also be used in the explanation of SHA-3 and be much more beneficial to the student/tutor. Both of these points are easily demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:RhoPi}.

\vspace{5mm}\\
Understandable in doing this efficiency and neatness is compromised, but these are not the main aims of the project therefore they are a necessary compromise. 
\vspace{5mm}\\
The Keccak website\cite{KeccakSite} and the SHA-3 wikipedia page\cite{SHA3Wiki} both have documentation which give a broken down implementation of SHA-3. Using this documentation, each subround was re-created in turn, in it's most simple form for understanding and seperating out each sub-round in turn.
\vspace{0mm}\\
\textit{It must be noted that while the Keccak website and the SHA-3 wikipedia page provide extremely useful information, they do contain conflicts in notation and one must be careful when using multiple sources to check for any conflicts and avoid confusion.}
\section{Tools}
This section will look at the implementation of each of the tools mentioned in the previous chapter.
\subsection{Visualising SHA-3}
After completing the visualisation of the state and the SHA-3 algorithm, the next step would be to merge the two implementations to give one working system.
\vspace{5mm}\\
From acknowledging a future problem, the compatibility of the two components, early on in the implementation, it has made the process of merging the two separate parts into one much easier. This is because the creation of the state in the CreateCubes class is of the same format which is to be entered into SHA-3 and also the same output of SHA-3. This means when the state is randomly generated, it can be immediately passed to the SHA-3 algorithm and an array of states will be returned, with each element containing the state at single unique points in the algorithm. Now any element in this array can be selected and displayed using the CreateCubes class, showing how the state progresses throughout SHA-3.
\subsection{Sub-Rounds}
Like the full visualisation of SHA-3, individual sub-rounds are equally simple to implement. By repeatedly calling one of the 5 sub-rounds in succession, one can again obtain an array which contains the states after each sub-round is applied. 
\vspace{5mm}\\
This tool is produced in the class ``SubRounds'', and although it is only a small segment of code, placing it in its own class gives greater flexibility when selecting specific starting states, navigation options and gives better organisation to the code.
\subsection{Cumulative Difference}
Generating the ``CumulativeDifference'' class requires more calculations than that of either the SHA-3Visualisation or the SubRounds class. The idea of this class is to develop a tool which calculates and visually shows how often each bit, in each position of the state flips, or changes from a 0 to a 1 or alternatively from a 1 to a 0. It is visualised in the CreateCubes class as a deepness of red, the redder a cube the more times it's value has changed. In figure \ref{fig:CumulativeDifference} it is easy to see the difference between the two states at two different stages in the algorithm.
\vspace{5mm}\\
\textit{A more in-depth analysis of these states will be given in the results chapter, as one may notice in figure \ref{fig:CompleteCD} an interesting property of the cumulative difference.}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\advance\leftskip-2cm
\begin{subfigure}{.6\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{CumulativeDifferenceEarly.png}
    \caption{Cumulative difference calculated for each bit in the state, mid-way through completing the algorithm.}
    \label{fig:HalfWayCD}
\end{subfigure}
\advance\rightskip-2cm
\hfill\begin{subfigure}{.6\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=1.04\textwidth]{CumulativeDifference.png}
    \caption{Cumulative difference calculated for each bit in the state, once SHA-3 has been completed in its entirety }
    \label{fig:CompleteCD}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Shows the cumulative difference at different point throughout the SHA-3 algorithm}
\label{fig:CumulativeDifference}
\end{figure}
\vspace{20mm}\\
The cumulative difference class first runs the SHA-3 algorithm on the initial state, storing the state at each point throughout the algorithm. This process is identical to the one used for the SHA3Visualisation class and is therefore logical to use this class to do this first step. The cumulative difference tool then goes a step further to begin to analyse the SHA-3 algorithm. This is done by taking the returned array of states from SHA3Visualisation, running through them and for each bit calculating the summation of the number of changes each bit has gone through. These summations are then stored into a state themselves and can them be used to display the cumulative difference in the CreateCubes class.
\subsection{Random Bit Difference}
Random bit difference, as discussed in the previous few chapters, looks to show the diffusion property of SHA-3. Again this tool builds on the ``SHA3Visualisation'' class. Firstly a randomly generated state is created, one bit is then selected from this state and is changed, now giving 2 similar, but unique, states. SHA-3 is then applied to both in turn giving now two very different arrays of states. The main function in this class, ``stateDifference'', takes in these two arrays of states and computes the difference at each point.
\vspace{5mm}\\
The state difference cycles through each of the arrays one after the other comparing the difference of each bit in the state with the bit of the same position in the other array. This is done simply by XORing the two values together. The function then returns an array of states containing the differences, the initial state containing only one difference and the final containing a 50/50 spilt of differences on average, as shown in figure \ref{fig:FlipBitDifference}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\advance\leftskip-1cm
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=1.02\textwidth]{SingleBitDifference.png}
    \caption{An intiail state with a single bit difference, as represented by the red cube.}
    \label{fig:initialStateFBD}
\end{subfigure}
\advance\rightskip-1cm
\hfill\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{MultipleBitDifference.png}
    \caption{The final state with many bit differences, represented by the red cubes.}
    \label{fig:FinalStateFBD}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{A clear illustration of the diffusion property in SHA-3}
\label{fig:FlipBitDifference}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0mm}\\
Above, in figure \ref{fig:FlipBitDifference} it is clear to see how very subtle changes in the initial conditions cause very different end states. Viewing individual steps within the algorithm, it becomes clear to the user how easily one bit change  propagates through the state.
\subsection{Random Bit Difference Summation}
Random bit difference summation resides within its own class, ``MultipleFlippedBit'' , and replicates the previously mentioned tool, flipped bit difference on a larger scale. Instead of creating only one different states with a single bit changed, multiple states are created with a single bit changed instead. For example, instead of starting with 2 initial states the class will use in excess of 20 states, each with only one bit difference from the generator state, the original, randomly generated state. After SHA-3 is applied to all the states, the tool sums the total number of differences between each state and the generator state and stores the values into a a state of its own, which is then returned. 
\vspace{5mm}\\
The total number of differences state is then displayed in a similar way to cumulative difference, by using the gradient of a colour to represent how many times a bit differs from the generator state.
\vspace{5mm}\\
Since changing one bit should make the state indistinguishable to the original state after SHA-3 is applied, effectively appearing random to anyone viewing the state. Summing multiple differences between these states will give a final total state which has very similar values in each element, again showing a clear illustration of the diffusion property.
\section{Navigation Bar and Menu}
\subsection{NavigationBar}
The navigation bar resides within each class, as the content of the navigation bar depends entirely on what the user is viewing at that moment and therefore relies on the tool currently being displayed.
\vspace{5mm}\\
 Each button within the navigation bar was created using the JButton class provided by Java libraries. This JButton then is positioned within a JPanel which is placed at the top of the window for ease of access.
\subsection{Menu}
The option menu will be the first window to open when the application is launched. It will provide the user with a list of the tools available to them, with the final element of this list containing settings. Settings allows the user to change options such as the size of the state.

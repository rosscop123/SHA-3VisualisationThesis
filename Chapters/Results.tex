\chapter{Results}
This chapter will look to answer the question of how successful this project has been. It will look at two different ways of measuring this. Firstly, returning to the project goals, stated in the specification and design chapter, and discussing whether each goal was a success or failure. The second analysis of the project will be achieved using user feedback. This will be done by allowing them to use the application and asking them specific questions surrounding their experience, whilst also asking users to compare learning SHA-3 with the application to without it.
